          <p>
            There’s deliberately no dates on here, and don’t expect any one
            feature to be guaranteed. We learn a lot as we are developing and
            designing Unison work and sometimes features aren’t the right fit at
            the current time.

            This page show cases the bigger efforts we are focused on and are
            considering. It doesn’t cover everything. Head over to our GitHub
            for more details on minor items, efforts, and bug fix work.
