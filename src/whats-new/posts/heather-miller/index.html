summary: Exciting news! Heather Miller, CMU professor and Scala Center founder,
  who does very cool research at the intersection of programming languages, FP,
  and distributed systems, will be a Visiting Researcher with us this summer.
  Like us, Heather is passionate about finding ways to make distributed
  programming more compositional. We'll be collaborating together on a library
  for distributed computing in Unison and some interesting demo application
  using that library.
