summary: There have been more than 700 commits to Unison's master branch since
  we last did one of these update posts, so a lot has happened. We've made a lot
  of bug-fixes and improvements to the ergonomics of Unison--too many to list
  them all here. Here are some highlights.

The usual pull request review process involves navigating large textual diffs, using a tool that has little understanding of your code. Unison has a semantic understanding of changes that are made to a namespace, and can report things like "this function was changed" or "this definition was moved from here to there" rather than "these 46 lines in this file are now different, as are these other 74 lines in this other file". Also, by storing the Unison codebase as serialized abstract syntax trees, we avoid merge conflicts and diffs due to things like formatting.</span></span></p><p><span class="span"><span class="word">Because of this more semantic understanding, the PR review process can also be more random-access, where one can hop around through semantically meaningful parts of the change rather than scrolling through large textual diffs.</span></span></p><p><span class="span"><span class="word">Though we still call them "pull requests" and though Unison repos are hostable on GitHub, we cannot actually use the GitHub pull request mechanism. Or at least, that would not be a nice experience.

In Unison, when you make a modification to a data type, you actually create a new type and any existing code needs to be made to use your new type instead of the old one. With the improvements we've made, you just need to issue an</span><span class="rich source inline-code"><code class="inline-code"><span class="word">update</span></code></span><span class="word">command in UCM, and it will try to update any code that depends on the changed data type.</span></span></p><p><span class="span"><span class="word">Sometimes this will result in code that doesn't typecheck, and Unison will let you know if that's the case so you can make the changes manually. To this end, we've also added commands that give you somewhat precise control of term and type replacements,</span><span class="rich source inline-code"><code class="inline-code"><span class="word">replace.term</span></code></span><span class="word">and</span><span class="group"><span class="join"><span class="rich source inline-code"><code class="inline-code"><span class="word">replace.type</span></code></span><span class="word">.</span></span></span><span class="word">These let you create patches that (when applied) replace all appearances of one term or type in a namespace with another.</span></span></p></section><section><h2 id="a-number-of-syntax-changes"><span class="span"><span class="word">A number of syntax changes</span></span></h2><p><span class="span"><span class="word">We've made some changes to Unison's surface syntax, hoping to make the language more ergonomic. Kudos go to Aaron Novstrup who contributed each of these improvements. 🙌 A cool thing about Unison is that we can change the syntax without breaking anyone's existing code!
