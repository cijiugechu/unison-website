summary: Since our last official update here, we started alpha testing a first
  release of Unison, gave a talk at Strange Loop, and have been working towards

Our goal with M2 is to have the core language and tooling be "feature complete and totally usable.‚Äù We have often used the metric of: ‚Äúa user can write Unison libraries without hitting major gaps or bugs that cause undue frustration.‚Äù</span></span></p><section><h2 id="strange-loop-was-great"><span class="span"><span class="word">Strange Loop was great!</span></span></h2><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gCWtkvDQ2ZI" width="580" height="436" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></p><p><span class="span"><span class="word">The approach I took in explaining Unison in the The Strange Loop talk was to focus on how the core idea of content-addressed code (explained in the talk) leads to a host of nice benefits, almost for free:</span></span></p><ul><li><span class="span"><span class="word">No builds, easy renames, test caching, and an overall better experience for codebase management</span></span></li><li><span class="span"><span class="word">No dependency conflicts</span></span></li><li><span class="span"><span class="word">Typed durable storage</span></span></li><li><span class="span"><span class="word">A better model for distributed execution and transparent code deployment</span></span></li><li><span class="span"><span class="word">... and I could have kept going! My favorite additional benefits that I didn't cover are having structured refactoring sessions rather than long lists of compile errors, and having a codebase that is always runnable - never broken.</span></span></li></ul><p><span class="span"><span class="word">Content-addressed code is one of those essential, simple ideas that feels like it ought to become ubiquitous in languages of the future. Even though it might seem elementary, it's also a fundamental change that affects almost everything about the developer experience. When Unison started as a research project based on this core idea, there were so many questions - things like</span><a href="https://twitter.com/unisonweb/status/1173942969726054401" class="named-link" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span class="span"><span class="word">if you can't ever modify a definition, only introduce new ones, how do you refactor or update a codebase?</span></span></a><span class="word">What has been surprising and cool is that all the questions around "how do you do X in the Unison worldview" continue to have answers, and these answers often make MORE sense than what is being done currently. Just by thinking through things with an open mind you can uncover an entirely consistent alternate reality of how programming could work, and it has been there the whole time just waiting to be discovered. That's been a lot of fun!</span></span></p></section><section><h2 id="working-towards-our-next-release"><span class="span"><span class="word">Working towards our next release</span></span></h2><p><span class="span"><span class="word">In the months leading up to Strange Loop and following the conference, we've been focused on filling in some gaps in the developer experience. Some things we've already done:</span></span></p><ul><li><span class="span"><span class="word">You can view the history of your codebase (the</span><span class="rich source inline-code"><code class="inline-code"><span class="word">history</span></code></span><span class="word">command).</span></span></li><li><span class="span"><span class="word">You can move around in that history (''undo'',</span><span class="group"><span class="join"><span class="rich source inline-code"><code class="inline-code"><span class="word">reflog</span></code></span><span class="word">,</span></span></span><span class="word">and</span><span class="rich source inline-code"><code class="inline-code"><span class="word">reset-root</span></code></span><span class="word">commands).</span></span></li><li><span class="span"><span class="word">You can run</span><span class="rich source inline-code"><code class="inline-code"><span class="word">IO</span></code></span><span class="word">programs without needing to add definitions to the codebase first, and you can run scripts that do</span><span class="rich source inline-code"><code class="inline-code"><span class="word">IO</span></code></span></span></li><li><span class="span"><span class="word">Literate Unison transcripts, for producing tutorial style documentation. For instance, much of</span><a href="/docs" class="named-link" rel="noopener" target="_self"><span class="span"><span class="word">the docs site</span></span></a><span class="word">could be moved over to be generated via the transcript runner, and we're also using these transcripts internally for integration testing.</span></span></li></ul><p><span class="span"><span class="word">Things we plan on getting done for our next major release:</span></span></p><ul><li><span class="span"><span class="word">Support for authoring API documentation</span></span></li><li><span class="span"><span class="word">A workflow for pull requests and code reviews</span></span></li><li><span class="span"><span class="word">A workflow for publishing and using Unison libraries</span></span></li><li><span class="span"><span class="word">A much better algorithm for refactoring types, which avoids manual propagation of edits</span></span></li><li><span class="span"><span class="word">Bugfixes and general polish - thank you to our alpha testers for uncovering and reporting issues, we will be cranking through those.</span></span></li></ul><p><span class="span"><span class="word">At that point the developer experience of using Unison will hopefully be pretty good - without major gaps, and anyone will be able to write and share Unison code without issue.</span></span></p></section><section><h2 id="in-progress-an-ecosystem-wide-code-viewer-with-click-through-to-definition-abilities"><span class="span"><span class="word">In progress: an ecosystem-wide code viewer with click-through to definition abilities</span></span></h2><p><span class="span"><span class="word">There's a cool project in the works that I wanted to mention here.</span></span></p><p><span class="span"><span class="word">One downside of the Unison codebase not just being a collection of text files is that we don't get to use rudimentary text-based tools to view that code. I prefer to see this as a feature, though, in that it creates a bit of a vacuum which can be filled by something that is</span><span class="italic"><span class="span"><span class="word">way better</span></span></span><span class="word">than the text based tool.</span></span></p><p><span class="span"><span class="word">Mitchell Rosen, Elliot Wu,</span><a href="https://github.com/unisonweb/elm-browser/graphs/contributors" class="named-link" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span class="span"><span class="word">and friends</span></span></a><span class="word">have started on a</span><a href="https://github.com/unisonweb/elm-browser" class="named-link" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span class="span"><span class="word">codebase browser for Unison</span></span></a><span class="word">which we are planning on hosting here at unisonweb.org/browse when it's a little further along. The idea is that you can hyperlink to any Unison definition, in any Git repo, and render that definition nicely with hyperlinks to all its dependencies. And rather than this being a build artifact that every library author must maintain and keep up to date, it's something that Just Works for all publicly hosted Unison code, without any action needed by library authors! It works by reading the underlying codebase format which has all the semantic information needed for this to be possible.</span></span></p><p><span class="span"><span class="word">I am very excited for this to come online.
