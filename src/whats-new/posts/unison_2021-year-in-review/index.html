It's much faster, and has revamped I/O and concurrency primitives including software transactional memory, and more. The new runtime uses a traditional compiler pipeline which takes the code through several intermediate stages before execution. We'll be reusing a lot of these stages when compiling to native code, coming this year!</span></span></p></section><section><h1 id="standalone-binaries"><span class="span"><span class="word">Standalone binaries</span></span></h1><p><span class="span"><span class="word">We also added support for</span><span class="group"><span class="join"><a href="https://twitter.com/pchiusano/status/1470242716688728075" class="named-link" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span class="span"><span class="word">self-contained bytecode files</span></span></a><span class="word">.</span></span></span><span class="word">You can now do</span></span></p><div class="rich source code ucm"><pre><code><span class="word">.&gt; compile.output mymain binary</span></code></pre></div><p><span class="span"><span class="word">This will output a small precompiled file</span><span class="rich source inline-code"><code class="inline-code"><span class="word">binary.uc</span></code></span><span class="word">that contains your</span><span class="rich source inline-code"><code class="inline-code"><span class="word">main</span></code></span><span class="word">function and its minimal transitive dependencies.

But this is not a great fit for Unison, for several reasons. Firstly, Git assumes that code is stored in text files, which is not the case for Unison. Secondly, the Unison codebase has its own internal history, its own notion of branches, and its own pull request mechanism, none of which can take advantage of Git.</span></span></p><p><span class="span"><span class="word">This year, all that is going to change.
